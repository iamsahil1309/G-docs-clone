# Collaborative Real-Time Text Editor

A **Google Docs-like** real-time collaborative text editor built using **React**, **Firebase**, **React Quill**, and **Lodash**. This application allows multiple users to edit a document simultaneously, and see live updates of each other's changes in real-time.

This app uses **Firebase Anonymous Authentication**, allowing users to join the document editing session without needing to sign in with an account. When users access the application, they are automatically logged in as anonymous users.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple users can work on the same document at the same time, with live updates.
- **Rich Text Editing**: Powered by **Quill**, providing a smooth and intuitive rich text editing experience.
- **Firebase Backend**: Firebase Realtime Database is used to store and sync document data across all users instantly.
- **User Authentication**: Firebase Authentication enables user sign-in and secure management of documents.
- **Optimized Performance**: Leveraging **Lodash** for optimized operations and handling large-scale updates efficiently.
